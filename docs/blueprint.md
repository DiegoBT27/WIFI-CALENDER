## Style Guidelines:

- The app uses a muted blue (#6495ED) as its primary color to create a professional and trustworthy impression.
- The background is very light blue (#E6EBF5), a subtle, almost white tone which reinforces the app's airy, spacious layout.
- A contrasting violet (#8B79F5) serves as an accent color. It draws the eye, creating a sense of balance with the primary blue and drawing attention to the most important parts of the screen.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for clarity and ease of use.
- Responsive design to ensure the app functions seamlessly on various screen sizes.
